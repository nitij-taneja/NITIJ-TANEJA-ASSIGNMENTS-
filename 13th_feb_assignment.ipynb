Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\\nNote: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.\\n\\nAnswer: The Exception class is the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python. When you create a custom exception, you should inherit\\nfrom the Exception class so that your custom exception is a subclass of the Exception class.\\n\\nBy inheriting from the Exception class, your custom exception will be able to take advantage of the behavior and functionality that is \\nalready built into the Exception class. This includes the ability to be raised and caught with a try/except block, and the ability to store\\nand retrieve error messages associated with the exception.\\n\\nInheriting from the Exception class also makes it easier to catch specific types of exceptions in your code. For example, you could catch \\nall exceptions that are subclasses of Exception using a single except block, or you could catch only specific types of exceptions by \\ncatching their corresponding custom exceptions.'"

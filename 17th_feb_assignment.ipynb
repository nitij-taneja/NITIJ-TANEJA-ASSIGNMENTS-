    "Q.1> What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, called BSON. It is designed to provide high performance, scalability, and flexibility for modern applications that require dynamic, complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional table-based relational database model used in SQL databases. Instead, they use flexible data models that can handle semi-structured and unstructured data, making them ideal for handling big data and real-time data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in situations where the application requires a high degree of scalability and flexibility, real-time processing of large volumes of unstructured data, and the ability to handle complex data models. It is also well-suited for use in modern web and mobile applications that require fast development cycles and agile data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.2> State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that provides a wide range of features that make it a popular choice for modern application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-based data model: MongoDB stores data in documents, which are similar to JSON objects. This allows for a flexible and scalable data model that can easily handle complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data and traffic with ease. It supports sharding, which allows you to distribute data across multiple servers for improved performance and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "High availability: MongoDB provides automatic failover and replica sets to ensure that your data is always available, even in the event of hardware or network failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible schema: MongoDB has a flexible schema, which means that you can easily modify your data model as your application evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich query language: MongoDB provides a powerful and flexible query language that allows you to perform complex queries on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation framework: MongoDB provides a built-in aggregation framework that allows you to perform complex data processing tasks such as grouping, filtering, and transforming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial support: MongoDB provides built-in support for geospatial data, allowing you to easily perform queries based on location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full-text search: MongoDB provides full-text search capabilities that allow you to perform text-based searches on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID transactions: MongoDB supports ACID transactions, allowing you to perform multiple operations on your data as a single, atomic transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.3> Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",

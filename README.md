WORK FOR PWSLILLS

29TH JAN ASSIGNMENT
Q1: Guido Van Rosuum developed Python Programming language.
Q2: Python is an interpreted programming language, which supports object-oriented, structured and functional programming.
Q3: Yes, Python is a case sensitib=ve language.
Q4: .py
Q5: Python code is both compiled and interpreted.
Q6: In Python, to define a block of code we use indentation. Indentation refers to whitespaces at the beginning of the line.
Q7: #
Q8: The function sys.version can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on. It also contains information on the build number and compiler used. For example, 3.5.2, 2.7.3 etc. this function also returns the current date, time, bits etc along with the version.
Q9: Python supports the creation of anonymous functions (i.e. functions that are not bound to a name) at runtime, using a construct called lambda. Lambda functions are restricted to a single expression. They can be used wherever normal functions can be used.
Q10: Preffered Installer Program
Q11: Print function is a built-in function which prints a value directly to the system output.
     sqrt function of math module return the square root of the provide number.
     type function helps to find the type of function.
     input function heps to get a input from user.
Q12: Identifiers can be of any length.
Q13: Simple to Use and Understand. For newcomers, Python is simple to understand and use. 
     Free and Open-Source. 
     Productivity has Increased. 
     Interpreted Language. 
     Extensive library. 
     Dynamically Typed. 
     Portability. 
     Supportive community.
Q14: Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. Interpreter takes care of Python heap and that the              programmer has no access to it.
-    The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Python memory manager. The core API of Python provides some tools for the programmer to code reliable        and more robust program.
-    Python also has a build-in garbage collector which recycles all the unused memory. When an object is no longer referenced by the program, the heap space it            occupies can be freed. The garbage collector determines objects which are no longer referenced by the sprogram frees the occupied memory and make it available to      the heap space.
-    The gc module defines functions to enable /disable garbage collector  
Q15: 1.Download the Python Installer binaries
     
     Open the official Python website in your web browser. Navigate to the Downloads tab for Windows.
     Choose the latest Python 3 release. In our example, we choose the latest Python 3.7.3 version.
     Click on the link to download Windows x86 executable installer if you are using a 32-bit installer. In case your Windows installation is a 64-bit system, then          download Windows x86-64 executable installer.
     
     2. Run the Executable Installer
     
     Once the installer is downloaded, run the Python installer.
     Check the Install launcher for all users check box. Further, you may check the Add Python 3.7 to path check box to include the interpreter in the execution            path.Customize Installation
     Select Customize installation. Choose the optional features by checking the following check boxes:
     Documentation
     pip
     tcl/tk and IDLE (to install tkinter and IDLE)
     Python test suite (to install the standard library test suite of Python)
     Install the global launcher for `.py` files. This makes it easier to start Python
     Install for all users.
     This takes you to Advanced Options available while installing Python. Here, select the Install for all users and Add Python to environment variables check boxes. 
     Once the installation is over, you will see a Python Setup Successful window.
     Add Python to environmental variables
     You have now successfully installed Python 3.7.3 on Windows 10. You can verify if the Python installation is successful either through the command line or through the IDLE app that gets installed along with the installation. Search for the command prompt and type “python”. You can see that Python 3.7.3 is successfully installed.


 The complete path of python.exe can be added by:

     Right-clicking This PC and going to Properties.
     Clicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.
     Clicking on the Environment Variables button on the bottom right.
     In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the      PATH variable.
     Clicking on New and entering Python’s install directory.
     
  Q16: Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the    indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

       "\"Q1: Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\\nof file opening.\\n\\nAnswer: The open() function is used to open a file in Python. When you open a file, you can specify the mode in which you want to open it. The\\ndifferent modes of opening a file in Python are:\\n\\n'r' (read mode) - This mode is used when you only want to read the contents of a file. When you open a file in read mode, you cannot write to it or \\nmake any changes to it. If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundError will be raised.\\n\\n'w' (write mode) - This mode is used when you want to write to a file. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten. If the file does\\nnot exist, a new file will be created.\\n\\n'a' (append mode) - This mode is used when you want to add new content to the end of an existing file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be \\ncreated. In append mode, you can only write to the end of the file, and not anywhere else.\\n\\n'x' (exclusive creation mode) - This mode is used when you want to create a new file and write to it, but only if the file does not already exist.\\nIf the file already exists, a FileExistsError will be raised.\\n\\n'b' (binary mode) - This mode is used when you want to read or write binary data to a file. When opening a file in binary mode, you should use 'rb' \\nto read binary data and 'wb' to write binary data.\\n\\n't' (text mode) - This mode is used when you want to read or write text data to a file. When opening a file in text mode, you should use 'rt' to read\\ntext data and 'wt' to write text data.\\n\\nYou can combine these modes when opening a file, for example: 'rb' to open a binary file in read mode, 'wt' to open a text file in write mode, etc. \\nThe default mode is 'rt' (read text mode) if no mode is specified.\""

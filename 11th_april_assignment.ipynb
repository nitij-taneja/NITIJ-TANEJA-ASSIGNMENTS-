By combining the predictions of multiple models, ensemble techniques can help to reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",

Unlike bagging, boosting assigns weights to the training instances and adjusts them during the learning process. It focuses on correcting errors made by previous models, giving more attention to the misclassified instances. Popular boosting algorithms include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. The final prediction is a weighted sum of the individual weak learners, resulting in an improved predictive performance."
